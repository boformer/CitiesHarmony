# CitiesHarmony

[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/CitiesHarmony.API)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CitiesHarmony.API/)

This C:SL mod provides Andreas Pardeike's [Harmony patching library](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) (version 2.2.2) to all mods that require it.

It hotpatches older Harmony versions (1.2.0.1 and 1.1.0.0) and adds limited cross-compatibility for Harmony 1.0.9.1. All of those versions are still used by various mods. The patching is necessary because Harmony 1.x is incompatible with 2.x.

The bundled `CitiesHarmony.Harmony.dll` (a fork of `0Harmony.dll`) contains additional bug fixes that are specific to the mono runtime of Cities: Skylines.

The associated Steam workshop item will be updated to the latest stable Harmony 2.x version in periodic intervals. By relying on a single `CitiesHarmony.Harmony.dll` for all mods, we can make sure that all mods use the latest version it that includes all bug fixes.

**By using auto-subscription, it is possible to migrate existing mods to Harmony 2.x without causing disruptions for users!**

## Documentation for Mod Developers

### API Package Installation

To use Harmony 2.x in your mod, add the [CitiesHarmony.API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CitiesHarmony.API/) nuget package to your project. The package includes the latest version of Harmony as well as the `HarmonyHelper` that is used to access it.

Make sure that when you build your mod:

* The `CitiesHarmony.API.dll` is copied to the AppData mod directory
* The `CitiesHarmony.Harmony.dll` is **not** copied to the AppData mod directory (it is provided by the central Harmony mod)

Depending on the version of Visual Studio, the project style and the post-build script you are using, there are different ways to achieve that:

* If you are manually copying the assemblies to AppData mod directory, make sure to copy only the DLL of your mod and the `CitiesHarmony.API.dll`, **not** the `CitiesHarmony.Harmony.dll`.
* If you are using the old Visual Studio project style (packages.config) with a post-build script, set "Local Copy" to true for `CitiesHarmony.API` reference and to **false** for `CitiesHarmony.Harmony` reference (check out the example in `ExampleMod.OldStyle` folder).
* If you are using the new Visual Studio project style (like the example mod in this repository) with a post-build target, no action is required after installing the Nuget package! It is configured so that `CitiesHarmony.Harmony` is not copied to the target directory (check out the example in `ExampleMod` folder).

### API Usage

**Make sure that there are no references to `HarmonyLib` in your `IUserMod` implementation.**
Otherwise the mod could not be loaded if CitiesHarmony is not subscribed. Instead, it is recommended to keep `HarmonyLib`-related code (such as calls to `PatchAll` and `UnpatchAll`) in a separate static `Patcher` class.

Before making calls to harmony in your code, you need to query `CitiesHarmony.API.HarmonyHelper` to see if it is available. There are 3 different hooks for that purpose:

* `void HarmonyHelper.DoOnHarmonyReady(Action)`: Will invoke the passed action when Harmony 2.x is ready to use. This hook should be called from `IUserMod.OnEnabled`. If the Harmony mod is not installed, this hook will attempt to auto-subscribe to it.
* `void HarmonyHelper.EnsureHarmonyInstalled()`: If you don't want to apply your patches in `IUserMod.OnEnabled`, call this method instead. It will perform the same auto-subscription as `DoOnHarmonyReady`
* `bool HarmonyHelper.IsHarmonyInstalled`: Returns `true` is Harmony is ready to be used. When queried, this hook will *not* attempt to auto-subscribe to the Harmony workshop item. Use this hook for all kinds of unpatching, applying patches in the `LoadingExtension` or while the simulation is running.

Take a look at the example mod in this repository for further inspiration!

It is recommened to add this mod as a dependency to your workshop item for transparency reasons.

#### Alternative A: Applying your patches in `OnEnabled`/`OnDisabled`

```c#
public class Mod : IUserMod {
    // ...

    public void OnEnabled() {
        HarmonyHelper.DoOnHarmonyReady(() => Patcher.PatchAll());
    }

    public void OnDisabled() {
        if (HarmonyHelper.IsHarmonyInstalled) Patcher.UnpatchAll();
    }
}
```

#### Alternative B: Applying your patches in `LoadingExtensionBase`

```c#
public class Mod : LoadingExtensionBase, IUserMod {
    // ...

    public void OnEnabled() {
        HarmonyHelper.EnsureHarmonyInstalled();
    }

    public override void OnCreated(ILoading loading) {
        if (HarmonyHelper.IsHarmonyInstalled) Patcher.PatchAll();
    }

    public override void OnReleased() {
        if (HarmonyHelper.IsHarmonyInstalled) Patcher.UnpatchAll();
    }
}
```

#### Example Patcher Class

```c#
public static class Patcher {
    private const string HarmonyId = "yourname.YourModName";
    private static bool patched = false;

    public static void PatchAll() {
        if (patched) return;

        patched = true;
        var harmony = new Harmony(HarmonyId);
        harmony.PatchAll(typeof(Patcher).Assembly); // you can also do manual patching here!
    }

    public static void UnpatchAll() {
        if (!patched) return;

        var harmony = new Harmony(HarmonyId);
        harmony.UnpatchAll(HarmonyId);
        patched = false;
    }
}
```
